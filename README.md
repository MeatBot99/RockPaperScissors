Odin Project exercise for a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that is supposed to be run entirely in the console.

Additions have been made to display the results of each match in the browser itself.

##Use:
Open the web document and follow the on screen prompts of choosing your weapon. There are only three available, 
and they are the namesake of the game.

Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

A draw happens when both players (or the computer and player) choose the same weapon; in this case, the round is 
restarted until a winner is declared.
