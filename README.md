Odin Project exercise for a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game.

## Dependencies:
Animate.css (for animations)
Javascript enabled

## Use:
Open the web document and follow the on screen prompts of choosing your weapon. There are only three available, 
and they are the namesake of the game.

-*Rock* beats *Scissors*

-*Paper* beats *Rock*

-*Scissors* beats *Paper*

A draw happens when both players (or the computer and player) choose the same weapon; in this case, the round is 
restarted until a winner is declared.
